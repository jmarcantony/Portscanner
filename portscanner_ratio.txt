no. of ports = x
time taken to scan x ports = y

ration x:y = 10000:1422 OR 5000:711

formula to find approx time to scan x number of ports:

                    For Linux Machine:
                         y = (1422 * x) / 10000
                                    OR
                         y = (711 * x) / 5000

                        Where y = time taken to scan
                        Where x = no. of ports
                    
                    For Windows Machine:
                        y = x
                        
                        Where y = time taken to scan
                        Where x = no. of ports
